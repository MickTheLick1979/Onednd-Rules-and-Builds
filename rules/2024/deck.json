An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm.

A creature that takes a {@action Study|XPHB} action to visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful {@dc 15} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation|XPHB}) check. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a {@spell Dispel Magic|XPHB} spell or a similar effect).
