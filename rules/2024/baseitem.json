Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.","Sling Bullets are typically stored in a {@item Pouch|XPHB} (bought separately)."],"name":"Sling Bullets (20)","packContents":[{"item":"sling bullet|xphb","quantity":20}],"page":222,"rarity":"none","source":"XPHB","srd52":true,"type":"A|XPHB","value":4,"weight":1.5},{"basicRules2024":true,"dmg1":"1d6","dmg2":"1d8","dmgType":"P","edition":"one","hasFluffImages":true,"mastery":["Sap|XPHB"],"name":"Spear","page":215,"property":["T|XPHB","V|XPHB"],"range":"20/60","rarity":"none","source":"XPHB","spear":true,"srd52":true,"type":"M|XPHB","value":100,"weapon":true,"weaponCategory":"simple","weight":3},{"ac":17,"armor":true,"basicRules2024":true,"edition":"one","hasFluffImages":true,"name":"Splint Armor","page":219,"rarity":"none","source":"XPHB","srd52":true,"stealth":true,"strength":"15","type":"HA|XPHB","value":20000,"weight":60},{"dmg1":"1d6","dmg2":"1d8","dmgType":"B","edition":"one","group":["Arcane Focus"],"mastery":["Topple|XPHB"],"name":"Staff","page":224,"property":["V"],"rarity":"none","scfType":"arcane","source":"XPHB","srd52":true,"staff":true,"type":"SCF|XPHB","value":500,"weaponCategory":"simple","weight":4},{"ac":12,"armor":true,"basicRules2024":true,"edition":"one","hasFluffImages":true,"name":"Studded Leather Armor","page":219,"rarity":"none","source":"XPHB","srd52":true,"type":"LA|XPHB","value":4500,"weight":13},{"basicRules2024":true,"dmg1":"1d8","dmg2":"1d10","dmgType":"P","edition":"one","hasFluffImages":true,"mastery":["Topple|XPHB"],"name":"Trident","page":215,"property":["T|XPHB","V|XPHB"],"range":"20/60","rarity":"none","source":"XPHB","srd52":true,"type":"M|XPHB","value":500,"weapon":true,"weaponCategory":"martial","weight":4},{"basicRules2024":true,"edition":"one","entries":[{"items":[{"entries":["Charisma"],"name":"Ability:","type":"item"},{"entries":["Play a known tune ({@dc 10}), or improvise a song ({@dc 15})"],"name":"Utilize:","type":"item"}],"style":"list-hang-notitle","type":"list"}],"name":"Viol","page":221,"rarity":"none","source":"XPHB","srd52":true,"type":"INS|XPHB","value":3000,"weight":1},{"edition":"one","group":["Arcane Focus"],"name":"Wand","page":224,"rarity":"none","scfType":"arcane","source":"XPHB","srd52":true,"type":"SCF|XPHB","value":1000,"weight":1},{"basicRules2024":true,"dmg1":"1d8","dmg2":"1d10","dmgType":"P","edition":"one","hasFluffImages":true,"mastery":["Sap|XPHB"],"name":"War Pick","page":215,"property":["V|XPHB"],"rarity":"none","source":"XPHB","srd52":true,"type":"M|XPHB","value":500,"weapon":true,"weaponCategory":"martial","weight":2},{"basicRules2024":true,"dmg1":"1d8","dmg2":"1d10","dmgType":"B","edition":"one","hammer":true,"hasFluffImages":true,"mastery":["Push|XPHB"],"name":"Warhammer","page":215,"property":["V|XPHB"],"rarity":"none","source":"XPHB","srd52":true,"type":"M|XPHB","value":1500,"weapon":true,"weaponCategory":"martial","weight":5},{"basicRules2024":true,"dmg1":"1d4","dmgType":"S","edition":"one","hasFluffImages":true,"mastery":["Slow|XPHB"],"name":"Whip","page":215,"property":["F|XPHB","R|XPHB"],"rarity":"none","source":"XPHB","srd52":true,"type":"M|XPHB","value":200,"weapon":true,"weaponCategory":"martial","weight":3},{"dmg1":"1d6","dmg2":"1d8","dmgType":"B","edition":"one","group":["Druidic Focus"],"mastery":["Topple|XPHB"],"name":"Wooden Staff","page":225,"property":["V"],"rarity":"none","scfType":"druid","source":"XPHB","srd52":true,"type":"SCF|XPHB","value":500,"weaponCategory":"simple","weight":4}]}
