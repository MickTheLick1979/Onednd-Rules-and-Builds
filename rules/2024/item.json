A {@variantrule Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB|Friendly} swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a {@variantrule Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB|Friendly} swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a {@variantrule Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB|Friendly} swarm starts its turn more than 30 feet away from you, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours."
