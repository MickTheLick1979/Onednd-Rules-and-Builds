        "The rules are purposely open-ended concerning mundane tasks like tying knots, but sometimes knowing how well a knot was fashioned is important in a dramatic scene when someone is trying to untie a knot or slip out of one. Here's an optional rule for determining the effectiveness of a knot.",
        "The creature who ties the knot makes an Intelligence ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check when doing so. The total of the check becomes the DC for an attempt to untie the knot with an Intelligence ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check or to slip out of it with a Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check.",
        "This rule intentionally links {@skill Sleight of Hand} with Intelligence, rather than Dexterity. This is an example of how to apply the rule in the {@variantrule Skills with Different Abilities|phb|\"Variant: Skills with Different Abilities\"} section in chapter 7 of the player's handbook."
