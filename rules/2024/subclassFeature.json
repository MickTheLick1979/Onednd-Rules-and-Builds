When you cast an Illusion spell with a spell slot, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute, during which it can't deal damage or give any conditions. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real and cross it."],"header":2,"level":14,"name":"Illusory Reality","page":175,"source":"XPHB","subclassShortName":"Illusionist","subclassSource":"XPHB"},{"activities":[{"activation":{"type":""},"damage":{"parts":[{"custom":{"enabled":true,"formula":"(@scale.barbarian.rage-damage)d6"},"types":["acid","bludgeoning","cold","fire","force","lightning","necrotic","piercing","poison","psychic","radiant","slashing","thunder"]}]},"target":{"affects":{"count":"1","type":"creature"}},"type":"damage"}],"className":"Barbarian","classSource":"XPHB","level":3,"migrationVersion":3,"name":"Frenzy","source":"XPHB","subclassShortName":"Berserker","subclassSource":"XPHB"},{"className":"Barbarian","classSource":"XPHB","effects":[{"changes":[{"key":"system.traits.ci.value","mode":"ADD","value":"charmed"},{"key":"system.traits.ci.value","mode":"ADD","value":"frightened"}],"disabled":true,"transfer":true}],"level":6,"migrationVersion":3,"name":"Mindless Rage","source":"XPHB","subclassShortName":"Berserker","subclassSource":"XPHB"},{"activities":[{"activation":{"condition":"When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you","type":"reaction","value":1},"name":"Retaliate","target":{"affects":{"count":"1","type":"creature"}},"type":"utility"}],"className":"Barbarian","classSource":"XPHB","level":10,"migrationVersion":3,"name":"Retaliation","source":"XPHB","subclassShortName":"Berserker","subclassSource":"XPHB"},{"activities":[{"activation":{"type":"bonus"},"consumption":{"targets":[{"type":"itemUses","value":"1"}]},"damage":{"onSave":"half"},"effects":[{"foundryId":"intimidatingPres"}],"save":{"ability":["wis"],"dc":{"calculation":"custom","formula":"8 + @abilities.str.mod + @prof"}},"target":{"affects":{"choice":true,"type":"creature"},"template":{"size":"30","type":"radius","units":"ft"}},"type":"save"},{"activation":{"type":""},"consumption":{"targets":[{"target":{"prop":"classFeature","uid":"Rage|Barbarian|XPHB|1"},"type":"itemUses","value":"1"},{"type":"itemUses","value":"-1"}]},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/trait-damage-immunities.svg","name":"Recharge with Rage","type":"utility"}],"className":"Barbarian","classSource":"XPHB","effects":[{"duration":{"rounds":1},"foundryId":"intimidatingPres","name":"Intimidated","statuses":["frightened"]}],"level":14,"migrationVersion":3,"name":"Intimidating Presence","source":"XPHB","subclassShortName":"Berserker","subclassSource":"XPHB"},{"activities":[{"activation":{"type":"bonus"},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/abilities/charisma.svg","name":"Eagle","type":"utility"},{"activation":{"type":""},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/abilities/intelligence.svg","name":"Wolf","target":{"affects":{"type":"ally"},"template":{"size":"5","type":"radius","units":"ft"}},"type":"utility"},{"activation":{"type":""},"effects":[{"foundryId":"rageOfTheWilds"}],"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/abilities/constitution.svg","name":"Bear","type":"utility"}],"className":"Barbarian","classSource":"XPHB","effects":[{"changes":[{"key":"system.traits.dr.value","mode":"ADD","value":"acid"},{"key":"system.traits.dr.value","mode":"ADD","value":"bludgeoning"},{"key":"system.traits.dr.value","mode":"ADD","value":"cold"},{"key":"system.traits.dr.value","mode":"ADD","value":"fire"},{"key":"system.traits.dr.value","mode":"ADD","value":"lightning"},{"key":"system.traits.dr.value","mode":"ADD","value":"poison"},{"key":"system.traits.dr.value","mode":"ADD","value":"thunder"}],"duration":{"rounds":1},"foundryId":"rageOfTheWilds","name":"Rage of the Bear"}],"level":3,"migrationVersion":3,"name":"Rage of the Wilds","source":"XPHB","subclassShortName":"Wild Heart","subclassSource":"XPHB"},{"activities":[{"activation":{"type":""},"consumption":{"targets":[{"type":"itemUses","value":"1"}]},"effects":[{"foundryId":"aspectOfTheWilds"}],"name":"Owl","target":{"affects":{"type":"self"}},"type":"utility"},{"activation":{"type":""},"consumption":{"targets":[{"type":"itemUses","value":"1"}]},"name":"Panther","target":{"affects":{"type":"self"}},"type":"utility"},{"activation":{"type":""},"consumption":{"targets":[{"type":"itemUses","value":"1"}]},"name":"Salmon","target":{"affects":{"type":"self"}},"type":"utility"}],"className":"Barbarian","classSource":"XPHB","effects":[{"changes":[{"key":"attributes.senses.darkvision","mode":"ADD","value":60}],"description":"You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
